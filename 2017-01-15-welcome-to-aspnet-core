## Creating a New Serene Application on ASP.NET Core

Currently, you have two options (in addition to low level ones, like git clone etc.) for initializing a new ASP.NET Core
Serene project.

- From Visual Studio -> New -> Project -> Serene (Asp.Net Core)
- Using our new *Serin* package from NPM

## Initializing a Serene ASP.NET Core Project Using SERIN (NPM)

### Check Node / NPM is Installed

Open a command prompt and type 

```cmd
> npm
```

to make sure that you have Node/NPM installed and is in your PATH.

If not, install it from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (LTS is recommended)

### Install Serin in Global Mode

Next step is to install *serin* package (Serene Initializer) using NPM:

> I would like to code *Serin* in .NET Core too, but its CLI is lacking automatic global package installation, 
way behind NPM in feature wise, and has lots of bugs.

**Windows:**
```
> npm install -g serin
```

**Linux / OSX:**

```sh
> sudo npm install -g serin
```

### Create Folder for New Project

Create an empty *MySerene* (or a name you like) folder.

Windows:

```cmd
> cd c:\Projects
> mkdir MySerene
> cd MySerene
```

Linux / OSX:

```sh
> cd ~
> mkdir MySerene
> cd MySerene
```
