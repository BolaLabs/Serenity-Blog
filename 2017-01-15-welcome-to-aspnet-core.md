Currently, you have two options (in addition to low level ones, like git clone etc.) for initializing a new Serene project.

- From Visual Studio -> New -> Project -> Serene (Asp.Net Core)
- Using our new *Serin* package from NPM

## Initializing a Serene ASP.NET Core Project Using SERIN (NPM)

Make sure you have Node/NPM installed, and they are in your path.

Type 

```cmd
> npm
```

to make sure that you have Node/NPM installed. 

If not, install it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (LTS is recommended)

Next step is to install *serin* package using NPM:

MAC/Linux:

```sh
> sudo npm install -g serin
```

Windows:
```
> npm install -g serin
```
